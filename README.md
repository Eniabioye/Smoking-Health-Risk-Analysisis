Smoking Health Risk Analysis (Power BI)


Project Overview

This project uses Power BI to analyze how smoking habits relate to health outcomes across different organs. The dashboard is designed to help users easily explore patterns between smoking behavior, patient demographics, and organ health status.

The goal of the project is to turn complex health data into clear visual insights that can support learning, awareness, and data-driven decision-making.

Objective

To understand the relationship between smoking and organ damage

To compare Healthy and Damaged patient groups

To identify patterns across age, BMI, gender, and smoking status

To demonstrate effective data visualization and storytelling using Power BI

Dataset Summary

The dataset includes patient-level information such as:

Age and gender

Body Mass Index (BMI)

Smoking status (Never, Current, Former)

Smoking duration and daily intake

Health status of major organs (Heart, Lungs, Liver, Kidneys, Full Body)

Cholesterol and hypertension risk indicators

Detailed Analysis Across Dashboard through filters

Healthy Heart 

Patient Population: 336 patients

Demographics:

• Average Age: 53.7 years
• Average BMI: 30.0 (indicates overweight/obese category)
Smoking Status Distribution:

• Never Smokers: 26.67%
• Current Smokers: 40.18%
• Former Smokers: 30.95%
Key Insights: The visualization shows a healthy, anatomically detailed heart with clear red (oxygenated) and blue (deoxygenated) blood vessels. Despite being in the 'healthy' category, 40.18% are current smokers, suggesting these patients have not yet developed detectable cardiovascular damage. The high average BMI (30.0) is concerning as it represents an additional cardiovascular risk factor.



Damaged Heart 

Patient Population: 193 patients (a 42.6% reduction from healthy group)

Demographics:

• Average Age: 54.9 years (slightly older)
• Average BMI: 30.1 (marginally higher)
Smoking Status Distribution:

• Never Smokers: 28.5%
• Current Smokers: 40.93%
• Former Smokers: 30.57%
Key Insights: The damaged heart appears darkened, suggesting tissue damage or necrosis. Interestingly, the smoking status distribution is remarkably similar to the healthy group, indicating that smoking damage may not be immediately reflected in smoking status alone. The presence of 28.5% never-smokers in the damaged category suggests other cardiovascular risk factors are at play.



Healthy Full-Body System 

Patient Population: 319 patients

Demographics:

• Average Age: 54.9 years
• Average BMI: 29.8
Smoking Status Distribution:

• Never Smokers: 21.63%
• Current Smokers: 47.65%
• Former Smokers: 30.72%
Key Insights: This comprehensive anatomical view shows all major organ systems (skull, lungs, heart, digestive system, circulatory system) in healthy condition. The higher percentage of current smokers (47.65%) compared to previous views suggests this may represent a broader health assessment beyond just cardiovascular health.



Damaged Full-Body System

Patient Population: 155 patients

Demographics:

• Average Age: 57.5 years (notably older)
• Average BMI: 29.2
Smoking Status Distribution:

• Never Smokers: 24.52%
• Current Smokers: 50.97%
• Former Smokers: 24.52%
Key Insights: The damaged visualization shows deteriorated organs with darkened lungs suggesting emphysema or COPD. The damaged group has the highest current smoker percentage (50.97%) and lowest former smoker percentage (24.52%), indicating poor smoking cessation rates among those with systemic damage. The average age is higher at 57.5 years, reflecting cumulative smoking exposure.



 Healthy Kidney  

Patient Population: 296 patients

Demographics:

• Average Age: 54.1 years
• Average BMI: 30.4 (highest among all groups analyzed)
Smoking Status Distribution:

• Never Smokers: 22.97%
• Current Smokers: 47.3%
• Former Smokers: 29.73%
Key Insights: The healthy kidney visualization shows normal renal anatomy with clear vascular structure. The highest average BMI (30.4) in this group is particularly concerning as obesity is a known risk factor for chronic kidney disease. Nearly half of patients with healthy kidneys are current smokers, representing a preventable risk population.



Damaged Kidney 

Patient Population: 174 patients

Demographics:

• Average Age: 53.9 years (surprisingly younger than healthy group)
• Average BMI: 29.0
Smoking Status Distribution:

• Never Smokers: 21.84%
• Current Smokers: 51.72%
• Former Smokers: 26.44%
Key Insights: The darkened kidney visualization suggests renal damage or disease. Counterintuitively, the damaged kidney group is slightly younger (53.9 vs 54.1 years) with over half being current smokers (51.72%), the highest rate among damaged organ groups. This suggests aggressive smoking patterns may cause earlier kidney damage.



Healthy Liver

Patient Population: 342 patients

Demographics:

• Average Age: 53.3 years
• Average BMI: 29.5
Smoking Status Distribution:

• Never Smokers: 25.15%
• Current Smokers: 47.66%
• Former Smokers: 27.19%
Key Insights: The healthy liver is shown in rich red-brown coloration indicating good vascular perfusion. This group has the largest patient population (342) and youngest average age (53.3 years), suggesting liver health may be more resilient to smoking damage compared to other organs.



Damaged Liver

Patient Population: 207 patients

Demographics:

• Average Age: 52.5 years (younger than healthy group)
• Average BMI: 28.9
Smoking Status Distribution:

• Never Smokers: 23.19%
• Current Smokers: 43.96%
• Former Smokers: 32.85%
Key Insights: The damaged liver appears darkened, potentially indicating cirrhosis or fatty liver disease. Remarkably, this damaged group is younger on average (52.5 years) and has a higher percentage of former smokers (32.85%), suggesting either liver damage from non-smoking causes or that liver damage may motivate smoking cessation.



Healthy Lung 

Patient Population: 310 patients

Demographics:

• Average Age: 54.6 years
• Average BMI: 29.3
Smoking Status Distribution:

• Never Smokers: 29.35%
• Current Smokers: 40.32%
• Former Smokers: 30.32%
Key Insights: The healthy lungs are displayed in bright pink with visible bronchial tree and clear tissue definition. Interestingly, this group has the highest percentage of never-smokers (29.35%) among all organ systems, which is counterintuitive given that lungs are the primary target of smoking damage. This suggests the classification may be based on current diagnostic imaging rather than cumulative exposure.



Damaged Lung 

Patient Population: 168 patients

Demographics:

• Average Age: 51.1 years (youngest damaged group)
• Average BMI: 29.6
Smoking Status Distribution:

• Never Smokers: 24.4%
• Current Smokers: 48.81%
• Former Smokers: 26.79%
Key Insights: The damaged lungs appear severely darkened, suggesting emphysema, chronic bronchitis, or COPD. This group is the youngest among all damaged organ categories (51.1 years) with nearly half being current smokers (48.81%), indicating lungs may show damage earlier than other organs. The presence of 24.4% never-smokers suggests exposure to secondhand smoke or environmental pollutants.



Data Inconsistencies

Counterintuitive Age Patterns: Multiple damaged organ groups are younger than their healthy counterparts, which contradicts typical disease progression models. This requires investigation into selection bias or misclassification.
Never-Smokers in Damaged Groups: Significant percentages of never-smokers appear in damaged categories (21-29%), raising questions about exposure to secondhand smoke, environmental toxins, or whether other comorbidities are confounding the analysis.
Selection Bias: The consistently high BMI across all groups (28.9-30.4) suggests this may not be a representative population sample, potentially limiting generalizability.
Survivorship Bias: Older patients with severe smoking-related damage may be missing from the dataset due to mortality, which could explain why some damaged groups are younger.
Confounding Variables: The analysis does not control for alcohol consumption, diet, exercise, genetics, occupational exposures, or other cardiovascular risk factors that could influence organ damage independent of smoking.
Smoking Measurement Limitations: The dashboard does not specify how smoking status is determined (self-report vs. biomarkers), pack-years calculation methodology, or verification of cessation in 'former smokers.'



Overall Key Insights

Organ damage is not limited to older patients: Some damaged organs appear in younger patients, suggesting early exposure or additional risk factors.

High smoking rates across all groups: A large proportion of both healthy and damaged patients are current smokers, showing that damage may develop gradually over time.

Organ-specific patterns:

Kidneys and lungs show stronger links to smoking damage

Liver damage includes a higher number of former smokers, possibly due to lifestyle changes after diagnosis

Heart health appears influenced by multiple factors beyond smoking alone

BMI is consistently high:
Most patients fall within the overweight or obese range, indicating obesity as a common co-risk factor.

Presence of never-smokers in damaged groups:
This suggests that environmental exposure, genetics, or other health conditions may also contribute to organ damage.



Recommendations

Add Pack-Years Calculation: Include pack-years (packs per day × years smoked) as a more precise smoking exposure metric.

Gender-Stratified Analysis: Break down each organ system by gender to identify sex-specific vulnerability patterns.

Cessation Impact Modeling: Add projections showing how organ health could improve with smoking cessation at different timepoints.

Intervention Tracking: Include metrics for smoking cessation program enrollment and success rates.

Alert System: Implement automated alerts for high-risk patients who meet multiple criteria for organ damage.


Conclusion

This project demonstrates how Power BI can be used to simplify complex health data and uncover meaningful patterns related to smoking and organ health. While the dashboard highlights important trends, it also shows the importance of understanding data limitations and interpreting results responsibly.

The anatomical visuals make the dashboard easy to understand, and the interactive filters allow users to explore health patterns across different organs.

However, some data quality and analysis issues limit how reliable the insights are. For example, damaged organs sometimes appear in younger patients, smoking rates are similar in both healthy and damaged groups, and there is no statistical testing to confirm the findings. This suggests that the health classifications may need review or that other confounding variables are being overlooked.

With clearer data definitions, stronger statistical analysis, and more advanced methods such as predictive modeling, the dashboard could become a useful tool for health education, risk assessment, and public health planning.

More importantly, the dashboard should be used as a hypothesis-generation tool rather than for definitive clinical decision-making until the methodological concerns are addressed and the findings are validated through rigorous statistical analysis.
